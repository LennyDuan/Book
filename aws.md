# AWS Certified Solutions Architect Notebook

This is a notebook record all the knowledge I learned for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect

Most of the content are learning from [Plurasight.com](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate&author=elias-khnaser&name=aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-m6&clip=3&mode=live). Thanks for this website and online course from Elias Khnaser. I will update/insert some images as well which are screenshots during the learning. This is only used for sharing the knowledge.
