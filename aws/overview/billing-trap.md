# Billing Trap {#billing-trap}

I try to use free-tier only during the learning period, but**alwaysalways**and**always**will have unexpected billing from AWS. It can be solved if you argue with[AWS support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?region=eu-west-1#). I have faced lots of issues and have solved some with the help of AWS support and I believe I will have**more**_accident billing_. I will record all the billing trap/accident here for the**free-tier**only.

_Feel free to add more accident/unexpected billing traps that easy occur for free-tier AWS._
