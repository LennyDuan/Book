##### From Course Transcript
 What we're going to do is configure the Wired Brain Coffee (WBC's) virtual private cloud. Now Wired Brain Coffee's my fictional company that we're going to use throughout the different scenarios. So what I've done here for the Wired Brain Coffee VPC design is we're going to select a region. In that region, we're going to create a VPC. Now for the VPC, we have to select a CIDR block. So for me, the CIDR block's going to be 192.168.0.0 with a /16. Now inside of the VPC, we're going to create multiple subnets. We're going to create two private subnets, and we're going to create one public subnet, or a DMZ. Now for the public subnet, or the DMZ, we're going to use the CIDR block 192.168.1.0 with a /24, and we're going do 2.0 for one of the private subnets and 3.0 for the other private subnet. Now what we're also going to do is we're going to put two of the subnets in availability zone A, and one of the subnets in availability zone B. Now for the private subnet, we're going to create instances, right? So in the private subnet you can have instances like database servers, you can have instances like application servers, like file servers, anything that you don't want to expose to the internet with a public IP address will typically be in a private subnet. In the public subnet, we're going to put things that are internet facing, typically web servers, NAT servers, VPN servers, etc., all of these things will typically be in a public-facing subnet or a DMZ. And again, in the other private subnet, you could put other servers, application servers for example. For the purposes of our demonstration, we're going to focus on the database server and the web server, you kind of get the point, but I just wanted to illustrate, from a design perspective, how you can do this. Now as I'm showing you this, and as you get more familiar with AWS, you'll start to find that there is more than one way to skin a cat. There's more than one way to design these things, but again for the purposes of our demonstration, this design was straightforward, so we're going to go ahead and do that. What we're also going to do is we're going to figure out how to have these instances connect to the internet. So, we have our router, our router is within our VPC, and the router, in order to get access to the internet, will need to go through an internet gateway, so we're also going to configure that, and we're going to configure the web-facing instances, the web server, for example, to have a direct access to the internet, it's going to have an elastic IP address, so it'll be internet-facing from both ways, you can connect to it, and you can also browse the internet directly from it. Now, for the instances and for the services that are going to be in the private subnets, those aren't going to have an elastic IP address or a public IP address, so you won't be able to access them directly from the internet, and they also won't have access to connect to the internet for updates or browsing or for whatever purposes, they won't also have internet connection until we configure a NAT gateway or a NAT way instance or an appliance that will allow these instances to then communicate with the internet through that NAT instance. So you'll be able to, these instances will gain internet access through this NAT instance.
