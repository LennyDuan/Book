# Billing Trap

I try to use free-tier only during the learning period, but **always** **always** and **always** will have unexpected billing from AWS. It can be solved if you argue with [AWS support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?region=eu-west-1#). I have faced lots of issues and have solved some with the help of AWS support and I believe I will have **more**  _accident billing_. I will record all the billing trap/accident here for the __free-tier__ only.

### Accident List:
* Only one EBS within 100/3000 IPS.
* EIP must associate with an instance.
* EC2 instances running hour total is 750
